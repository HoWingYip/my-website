      <h1>Hi, I'm Wing Yip.</h1>
      <p>I'm a major nerd who absolutely loves mathematics and programming, and seeks to pursue math and computer science. I'm not exceptionally knowledgeable in any fields of mathematics, but my current favourite would probably be vector calculus.</p>
      <p>I've studied in Hwa Chong Institution since 2017, and will graduate in 2022. During my time in Hwa Chong, I've gained an incredible wealth of knowledge, forged invaluable friendships, and met several competent and conscientious collaborators whom I enjoy working with to this day.</p>
      <p>Code is a huge part of my life. I've completed several software projects for my school, as well as in pursuit of my own interests. Check them out on the <a href="/projects">Projects</a> page!</p>
      <p>If you enjoyed getting to know me through this website, perhaps you'd like to get to know me in person too! Feel free to drop me an email at user@example.com, or find me at <a href="https://github.com/HoWingYip" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>github.com/HoWingYip</span></a>.</p>
